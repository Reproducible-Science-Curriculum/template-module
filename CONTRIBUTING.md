## How to contribute

* All contributions should be through [pull request]. You will
  probably use the "Fork & pull" model.

* Keep a pull request topically related. i.e., only bundle strictly
  related changes into a pull request.
  
* We are trying to follow [these guidelines](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/workshop-planning/blob/master/moduleTemplate.md).
 Any changes should make us more conforming, not less.
 Also, please use this [template for modules][template-module].
