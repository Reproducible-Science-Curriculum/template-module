Each lesson within the module should have accompanying instructor notes (with a corresponding file name).

Instructor notes should be written in plain Markdown.

The instructor notes should contain:

1. Guidance on what to do at the start of the module (any setup checks etc.)
2. Short introduction section (with estimated time needed for it).
3. Information how much time should be allocated for each section.
4. Summary of activities / exercises suggested in the slides.
5. Tips for instructors.
6. Guidelines for group discussion (if applicable).
7. Final reflections.
